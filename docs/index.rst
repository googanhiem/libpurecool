This Python 3.4+ library allow you to control `Dyson fan/purifier devices <http://www.dyson.com/air-treatment/purifiers/dyson-pure-hot-cool-link.aspx>`_ and `Dyson 360 Eye robot vacuum device <http://www.dyson.com/vacuum-cleaners/robot/dyson-360-eye.aspx>`_.

Status
------

Backward compatibility is a goal but breaking changes can still happen.

Discovery is not fully reliable yet. It's working most of the time but sometimes discovery will not work. Manual configuration is available to bypass this limitation.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: shell

    pip install libpurecool


Dyson account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to access the devices, you need to have access to a valid Dyson account.

.. code:: python

    from libpurecool.dyson import DysonAccount

    # Log to Dyson account
    # Language is a two characters code (eg: FR)
    dyson_account = DysonAccount("<dyson_account_email>","<dyson_account_password>","<language>")
    logged = dyson_account.login()

Fan/Purifier devices

Connect to devices
##################

After login to the Dyson account, known devices are available.

Connections to the devices can been done automatically using mDNS or manually with specifying IP address

Automatic connection (mDNS)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code:: python

    from libpurecool.dyson import DysonAccount

    # Log to Dyson account
    # Language is a two characters code (eg: FR)
    dyson_account = DysonAccount("<dyson_account_email>","<dyson_account_password>","<language>")
    logged = dyson_account.login()

    if not logged:
        print('Unable to login to Dyson account')
        exit(1)

    # List devices available on the Dyson account
    devices = dyson_account.devices()

    # Connect using discovery to the first device
    connected = devices[0].auto_connect()

    # connected == device available, state values are available, sensor values are available

Manual connection

.. code:: python

    from libpurecool.dyson import DysonAccount

    # Log to Dyson account
    # Language is a two characters code (eg: FR)
    dyson_account = DysonAccount("<dyson_account_email>","<dyson_account_password>","<language>")
    logged = dyson_account.login()

    # Connect using discovery to the first device
    connected = devices[0].connect("192.168.1.2")

    # connected == device available, state values are available, sensor values are available

Disconnect from the device
##########################

Disconnection is required for fan/purifier devices in order to release resources (an internal thread is started to request update notifications)

.. code:: python

    from libpurecool.dyson import DysonAccount

    # ... connection do dyson account and to device ... #

    # Disconnect
    devices[0].disconnect()

API Documentation
-----------------

If you are looking for information on a specific function, class, or method,
this part of the documentation is for you.

.. toctree::
    api

How it's working
----------------
Dyson devices use many different protocols in order to work:

-  HTTPS to Dyson API in order to get devices informations (credentials, historical data, etc ...)
-  MDNS to discover devices on the local network
-  MQTT (with auth) to get device status and send commands

To my knowledge, no public technical information about API/MQTT are available so all the work is done by testing and a lot of properties are unknown to me at this time.

This library come with a modified version of `Zeroconf <https://github.com/jstasiak/python-zeroconf>`_ because Dyson MDNS implementation is not valid.

This `documentation <https://github.com/shadowwa/Dyson-MQTT2RRD>`_ help me to understand some of return values.

Work to do
----------

-  Better protocol understanding
-  Better technical documentation on how it is working
-  Get historical data from the API (air quality, etc ...)
